Passionate about technology and eager to start my professional career as a Software Developer, I've learned Front-End Development @ CourseIT, where I used React, Javascript, HTML & CSS as the core technologies for the practice projects. I've learned Node.js watching helpful videos on social media.
  
I'm also taking a undergraduate degree @ UADE, where I started learning Python and I'll learn JAVA in the upcoming years.
