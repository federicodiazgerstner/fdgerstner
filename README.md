Passionate about technology and eager to start my professional career as a Software Developer, I'm currently learning Front-End Development technologies @ CourseIT, where I'll learn jQuery, Node.js, React.js, as well as HTML and CSS.  
I'm also taking a undergraduate degree @ UADE, where I started learning Python and I'll learn JAVA in the upcoming years.
